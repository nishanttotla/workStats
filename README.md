workStats
=========

workStats (still under construction) is a calculator for various statistics, given a list of time intervals with timestamps.
Give it a CSV file with the following entries: start date, start time, end date, end time. It will help you calculate various statistics about those time intervals, and make neat plots for you to admire.
Stats it calculates:


Here's some background:
I'm a pretty normal grad student, with a chronic procrastination problem. Except that it gets out of hand sometimes. I also love data and numbers. So I decided to beat procrastination with my love for data, and started recording time intervals for when I worked. The challenge was to meet goals, do better etc. I use a time journaling app on my phone to record this, but anything works. I'm sure there are some studies which prove that merely getting quantitative feedback helps humans improve. At least it works for me.
With this is mind, here are the categories of things I time and analyze using this (Note that I stop counting as soon as I start procrastinating. Overall, this is much more fun that the Pomodoro method):

1. Research: Research, the stuff that I get paid for.
2. Personal Projects: Any personal undertaking that I do on my own time (such as workStats, for instance)
3. Classes: I got to take classes too
4. Class Work: Homework and assigned reading does not count as research.
5. Group Meetings: Any meeting where I'm an equal participant, is done in a large-ish group, and I'm not necessarily the focus of it.
6. 1-1 Meetings: Any meeting with a person (or persons) where I'm the focus.
7. Events: Any talks, seminars, or related activity.

I have also wanted to include the following things at some stage, but that might be overkill, and also harder to keep track of, not to mention annoying:
1. Commute
2. Exercise
3. Cooking
